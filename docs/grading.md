# Grading

## How it works

Grading is determined based on looking at a dictionary.

The grade is applied to a lift. The athlete is awarded if they have achieved the total for the current year.

This is represented as a badge.

## Future

The plan is to store the grades on a database, linking to weight catetory and setting a _era_ in case they change from year to year.
