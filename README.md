This is a database of all lifts and competitions in the past, present and future.

## Documentation

[The documentation can be found here](https://weightliftingnz.github.io/lifter-api).

## About

[Here is a video outlining the project](https://youtu.be/1kObqjeRs2I).

Instead of using .pdf's and Excel files to display competition results, I wanted to make a database for [Weightlifting New Zealand](https://weightlifting.nz). This allows more flexibility in reviewing results. Another bonus is that we can peek into an individual's athletic career.
